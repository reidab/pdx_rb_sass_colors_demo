      <div class='description'>
        <p>People of all levels of interest around Wikis - expert to curious - are welcome to this open house of Wiki on the first Wednesday of each month at 5:30 PM at the AboutUs offices.</p>

<p>Note that the doors of the Olympic Mills Building, where AboutUs is located, are locked at promptly at 5:30, so look for a note on the north-side door with a phone number to call if you are locked out.</p>

<p>Discussion is informal and takes a collaborative flair. It’s a good place to meet people from all walks of life, who make wikis, are in communities that use them, can help you figure out what a wiki can do for you, and for you to discover wikis in general.</p>

<p>The atmosphere encourages just hanging out to chat and generally cavort with a group of like-minded about open sources and community. It’s a monthly celebration of wiki community in Portland, the birthplace of the wiki.</p>

<p>Portland wiki planning and development can be found at the Portland wiki page <a href="http://pdx.wiki.org/Main_Page">http://pdx.wiki.org/Main_Page</a> . Portland Wiki Conference page.</p>

<p>If you're not located near Portland, there are several other Wiki Wednesdays</p>

        <p>Slashdotters' outrage meters were pegged again recently when somebody noticed that HP had gotten patent #7,523,150 last April. But what is the patent really about? And how did HP get it?</p>

<p>IP attorney Dave Madden of Mersenne Law LLC will present a quick overview of the patent process and then discuss the HP patent itself. It's very short (only 5 pages) and it's about an area of technology that's familiar to many engineers (binary representation of numbers in a computer), so it's a good vehicle to get into a discussion about the patent system, rather than the intricate details of a complicated invention.</p>

<p>Join us at the OTBC offices at noon on Thursday, February 4, 2010, for a brown-bag lunch, discussion and Q&A.</p>

<p>All programming languages welcome. Come work on your own projects, work on others participants' projects, get advice, have fun, etc.</p>

<p>You're encouraged to bring a computer, but can team up with others that brought one too.</p>

<p>				    A Talk
<br />				      by</p>

<p>				Jeri Ellsworth
<br />                                (Circuit Girl)</p>

<p>     Jeri Ellsworth is a native Oregonian, born in Yamhill and raised
<br />     in Dallas, Oregon.  Early on she became fascinated with electronics 
<br />     and 8-bit computers setting the stage for her unique approach to 
<br />     learning.  Not being challenged in school, she skipped higher 
<br />     education to pursue a career in car-racing and chassis fabrication.
<br />     After that, she opened a chain of computer stores in Oregon and 
<br />     Washington.  She sold those to peruse a career in chip design,
<br />     which lead her to design the CommodoreOne - based upon the 
<br />     Commodore 64 - using reconfigurable logic and the C64 DTV 30- 
<br />     games-in-one joystick, selling, a quarter million units.
<br />     She currently works as an Oregon based consultant.   
<br />  
<br />     I'm not sure what Jeri is going to speak about yet, but judging
<br />     the talk she gave at Sanford, it should be very good indeed.
<br />     See a video of her Sanford talk at:

        <p>Research Club Brunches are  creating a context where active and interesting poepl can meet each other and talk about what they are doing while having a little something to eat. It will be informal and relaxed, but to encourage the spread of ideas we'll be setting aside a time for anyone who wants to present something about what they do.</p>

<p>The first two brunches were super successful, and we were absolutely blown away by the quality of the speakers.  See a brief discussion of the first brunch here &lt;http: />  (thanks to Lisa Radon) and photos from the second brunch here &lt;http: />  (thanks to Kerosene Rose). </p>

<p>The presenter's list for Brunch #3 is looking great already. Get in touch if you're curious about presenting.</p>

<p>We will provide a free, simple, vegetarian and vegan-friendly brunch to attendees, and the kitchen will be available to anyone interested in cooking. 
<br />This will be the second of at least 5 brunches on an approximately-monthly basis, so if you can't make it to this one, there will be two more.</p>

<p>In the interest of pushing Research Club closer to its collaborative, spontaneous ideals, we've created an online sign-up &lt;http: />  for the basic tasks of brunch. If you can't contribute in that way, please consider a small donation to Tribute Gallery and Research Club. </p>

<p>Details:
<br />Where: Tribute Gallery 328 NW Broadway #117
<br />When: February 7, 11:30 am to 3pm, Presentations to start at 1:00, at which point the food may be gone
<br />Bring: Yourself and a friend!
<br />How: Please RSVP to <a href="mailto:pesearchclub@gmail.com">pesearchclub@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>Hope you are able to join us!</p>

<p>Best,
<br />Research Club</p>

        <p>Announcing Agile Open Northwest 2010! This Agile Open Space event will be
<br />held February 9th and 10th, 2010, in the Seattle Center Northwest Rooms.
<br />Please see <a href="http://www.agileopennorthwest.org">http://www.agileopennorthwest.org</a> for registration information
<br />and further details.</p>

<p>We invite you to our fourth annual Agile Open Northwest conference.
<br />Alternating each year between Portland and Seattle, AONW conferences bring
<br />together practicing members of the Northwest Agile communities to explore
<br />the latest developments in agile software development. We held our third
<br />annual event last year in Portland and enjoyed another great success.
<br />Registration is $125.00 for both days, including light breakfast and lunch.
<br />This low-cost regional conference is a great opportunity to connect with the
<br />local agile community, experts and novices alike.</p>

<p>Please join us this year as we host 125 experienced, collaborative,
<br />committed agile practitioners from the Northwest U.S. (and beyond) in
<br />tackling the issues around our recurring theme "Agile for Real." As in past
<br />years, attendance is limited to a predetermined number in order retain the
<br />many advantages a small conference has to offer.</p>

<p>Here is a comment from a previous attendee:</p>

<p>"These two-day Agile Open Northwest conferences are an extremely good value.
<br />..[Y]ou learn directly from practitioners in the agile community what works
<br />and what doesn't. I attended the first two of these conferences, they were
<br />stunningly good... loads of practical, useful stuff and stimulating
<br />discussions." -- Ian Savage, PNSQC Program Chair</p>

<p>More information can be found at <a href="http://www.agileopennorthwest.org">http://www.agileopennorthwest.org</a>. Registration is open now. We look forward to seeing you there.</p>      </div>

<p>About the Event:
<br />In challenging economic times and as competition grows fiercer, many companies find that enforcement of their intellectual property rights is critical to their success.  Knock-off products, often from companies outside the United States, eat into sales.  But defending your intellectual property is not inexpensive.   Three of Portland’s leading companies will tell you how they defend their domestic and foreign markets quickly, efficiently, and inexpensively, and how to make these strategies work on any scale. </p>

<p>What will you learn?
<br /> - How to diversify your IP portfolio to put your company in the best position to defend your markets 
<br /> - How to use the laws of foreign jurisdictions to stop infringing products where they are manufactured 
<br /> - How to use the fastest, most cost-effective IP enforcement actions available </p>

<p>Panelists:
<br /> - Tom Evans, Corporate Patent Attorney at Mentor Graphics will relate lessons from Mentor’s patent infringement lawsuit in China and describe how Mentor uses its IP portfolio to defend its markets around the world.</p>

<p> - Julianne Davis, Assistant General Counsel/Intellectual Property at Nike, Inc. will tell you why you should add design patents, trademark registrations, and copyright registrations to your IP portfolios, and how Nike uses its diverse portfolio to police its markets in the US and around the world.</p>

<p> - John Motley, Associate General Counsel & Director of Intellectual Property at Columbia Sportswear, will talk about Columbia’s successful use of Thai and other foreign patent and trademark law to combat infringement where products are manufactured.</p>

<p> - Tigran Guledjian, a partner at Quinn Emanuel in Los Angeles, practices extensively in complex intellectual property litigation with an emphasis in high technology patent litigation.  Tigran will discuss his efforts on behalf of Seiko Epson and other clients to use the International Trade Commission to obtain and use exclusion orders to stop infringing products at the border.</p>

<p>Moderator:
<br /> - Brenna Legaard is a partner at Chernoff Vilhauer McClung & Stenzel, an intellectual property law firm in Portland, Oregon. A seasoned trial lawyer, Brenna brings significant real-world experience to her patent prosecution and opinion practice and routinely helps start ups and publicly traded clients alike prioritize their IP budgets and cost-effectively enforce their rights against infringers.</p>

        <p>The Springboard Social Innovation Forum offers a monthly event designed to support those interested in creating a better future. Our focus is to help practitioners or potential practitioners of social projects push beyond discussion and debate into action. Each Forum will inspire and teach with ideas, powerful role models, and stories. Speakers, content experts, panels, and workshops will help you improve your strategies for planning and launching effective social ventures. The Forum will create a context to connect, learn, and take action around ideas that lead to tangible change—all in a venue designed for building community.</p>

<p>Join us for a “working Forum,” where Portlanders will put our heads together to discuss the best ways to create and support social innovation in Portland and in other communities nationwide. We will be exploring Springboard’s latest initiative, Innovative Cities--a framework of the necessary conditions for nurturing and sustaining social innovation within a city. The Innovative Cities Model is a guide for cities to adopt which provides a place for existing social innovation resources to be listed, and then publishes them in a searchable database for other cities to replicate. </p>

<p>SPACE IS LIMITED, and RSVP is REQUIRED! Please contact Mary Grace at (503) 452-6898 or <a href="mailto:marygracehinkle@gmail.com">marygracehinkle@gmail.com</a></p>

<p>Cost is $10.00 at the door, which will offset costs and provide a light dinner. </p>      </div>

<br />6:45 Program: Co-Working in Oregon</p>

<p>PROGRAM:</p>

<p>Co-working is a growing movement around the United States and across the world. As more people work from home or work while they are traveling or are in the midst of a rapid startup cycle, they find that they can be more effective and more productive by gathering together to work. Starting with projects like the Hat Factory in San Francisco, co-working sites have bloomed. There are several co-working facilities in the Nortwest, some which are expanding to multiple cities and some that focus on specific audiences or markets. The February SAO meeting will be a panel discussion by three Oregon co-working entrepreneurs: Jeff Jimmerson from Madison Avenue Collective in Corvallis, Josh Friedman from Ned Space in Portland and Rick Turoczy from Portland Innovation Experiment.</p>

<p>Jeff Jimerson, founder of the Madison Ave. Collective (<a href="http://www.madcollective.com/">http://www.madcollective.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Madison Ave. Collective (the MAC) is a shared office and studio space located in downtown Corvallis, 72 steps west of Starbucks on the corner of 5th street and—you guessed it—Madison Ave. After three months of heavy remodeling, Jeff opened the space on 08/08/08 with a "nice people wanted" Craigslist ad.</p>

<p>Today, twelve creative and tech professionals call the MAC home for their respective small businesses.</p>

<p>Rick Turoczy, founder of Silicon Florist (<a href="http://siliconflorist.com/">http://siliconflorist.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Rick Turoczy has been working in high-tech marketing communications jobs in the Portland area for the past 15 years. Out of pure dumb luck, he happened to sit up in bed at 2 AM one night in August 2007 with the inspiration to start Silicon Florist, a blog about Portland startups in the Web, Mobile, and Open Source scenes.</p>

<p>Since then, he’s chatted with The Oregonian a bunch of times, appeared on local television and radio, made a brief appearance on the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer, garnered bylines in The New York Times, spoken at numerous events, been selected as a runner up for the Portland Business Journal’s “40 under 40,” launched a startup incubator with the help of Wieden+Kennedy, and co-produced a groundbreaking Web-based telethon called 30 hour day.</p>

<p>All because of a blog. Weird.</p>

<p>Josh Friedman, co-founder of NedSpace (<a href="http://www.nedspace.com/">http://www.nedspace.com/</a>)</p>

<p>Josh Friedman is the co-founder of NedSpace, a provider of co-working facilities for entrepreneurs and startups. NedSpace is designed to be the place where entrepreneurs go to build and grow their businesses. Along with his business partner Mark Grimes, NedSpace has itself grown quickly into two locations from its launch in early 2009. The goal is to open 10 more locations throughout the US in 2010, and eventually to have a NedSpace in every city with a startup ecosystem.</p>

<p>Josh serves on the Board of Starve Ups, a Portland-based entrepreneurial organization and the Oregon Entrepreneurs Forum Advisory Board. He holds a B.S. degree in speech communication from Oregon State University. Aside from helping entrepreneurs grow their companies, you might find him rock climbing, skiing, cycling, brewing beer or generally causing trouble along with his dog Ace.</p>      </div>
